# CreatingACharacter

This is a project designed to read through a story and analyze its content to create a detailed profile for the characters. The system is currently configured to identify and extract information such as names, occupations, job statuses, methods of learning, and programming languages mentioned in the text. Dummy information has been provided for each of these categories to serve as placeholders in case they are mentioned in the story.

When the system identifies relevant information in the text, it assigns it to a character object, which forms the basis of the character's attributes. These attributes can then be displayed to the user, providing a comprehensive profile of the character."

## Platform Used
Python3 Virtual Envionment

## Purpose

The primary objective of this program is to sift through stories and construct characters that can be stored as objects. This functionality enables users to effortlessly browse through documents and compile information that delineates the composition of characters. While its applications extend to various domains within DevOps, in this instance, it showcases a glimpse of its potential.
